It provides expert-corrected tumor segmentations, harmonized clinical and demographic variables, and baseline AI model weights to support breast cancer AI research.",

  "agent_thoughts": "The document describes the creation of the MAMA-MIA dataset. \n\n1.  **Investigation Extraction**: The title is clearly stated. The description is summarized from the abstract. The study is a Data Descriptor for a benchmark dataset.\n\n2.  **Study Factors**: Identified from the 'Data Records' and 'Technical Validation' sections (e.g., Scanner Manufacturer, Magnetic Field Strength, Clinical outcomes).\n\n3.  **ISA Hierarchy (Workflow)**:\n    *   **Data Collection**: Sourced from TCIA (ISPY1, ISPY2, NACT, DUKE). Selection criteria (Fig 2) applied.\n    *   **Harmonization**: Consolidating clinical data, standardizing image orientation (Fig 1).\n    *   **Segmentation Workflow**: \n        *   Preliminary segmentation using nnU-Net (trained on auxiliary data).\n        *   Visual QC by 2 radiologists.\n        *   Expert correction by 16 experts using Mango viewer.\n    *   **Baseline Model**: Training a new nnU-Net on the final expert annotations.\n\n4.  **Tools & Models**: \n    *   Software: nnU-Net, Mango viewer, nibabel, SimpleITK, pandas, pycad.\n    *   Models: nnU-Net (used for both preliminary and baseline).\n\n5.  **Measurements**: DSC, Hausdorff Distance (validation), FTV, SER (volumetric analysis).\n\n6.  **Metadata**: Extracted case counts (1506), license (CC-BY-NC), and repository location.",
