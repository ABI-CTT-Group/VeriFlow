    "description": "A multicenter dataset (MAMA-MIA) of 1506 pre-treatment T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) cases, including expert annotations of primary tumors and non-mass-enhanced regions. The dataset integrates imaging data from four collections in The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Preliminary segmentations generated by a deep learning model were corrected and verified by 16 breast cancer experts, resulting in a fully annotated dataset. The resource includes 49 harmonized clinical and demographic variables, 22 imaging parameters, and pre-trained weights for a baseline nnU-Net model, serving as a benchmark for advanced deep learning models in breast cancer diagnostics and treatment response prediction.",
