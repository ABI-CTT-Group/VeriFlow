    "description": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) research in breast cancer Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) faces challenges due to limited expert-labeled segmentations. We present a multicenter dataset of 1506 pre-treatment T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI cases, including expert annotations of primary tumors and non-mass-enhanced regions. The dataset integrates imaging data from four collections in The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). A deep learning model was trained to produce preliminary segmentations for the remaining cases, which were subsequently corrected and verified by 16 breast cancer experts. The dataset also includes 49 harmonized clinical and demographic variables, as well as pre-trained weights for a baseline nnU-Net model.",
