MAMA-MIA: A large-scale multi-institution MRI-based breast cancer dataset

This context file provides supplemental information for the Scholar Agent.

STUDY OVERVIEW:
- Dataset Name: MAMA-MIA (Multi-institutional Annotated Mammography Images for AI)
- Modality: Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI)
- Subjects: 1,506 patients from multiple institutions
- Annotations: Breast tumor segmentation masks, clinical metadata

METHODOLOGY:
1. Data Acquisition: DCE-MRI scans collected from multiple institutions
2. Preprocessing: DICOM to NIfTI conversion, intensity normalization
3. Annotation: Expert radiologist segmentation of breast tumors
4. Model Training: 2D and 3D U-Net architectures for segmentation
5. Evaluation: Dice coefficient, Hausdorff distance

KEY TOOLS:
- dcm2niix: DICOM to NIfTI conversion
- nnU-Net: Self-configuring U-Net framework
- SimpleITK: Image processing library
- PyTorch: Deep learning framework

DATA FORMATS:
- Input: DICOM series (application/dicom)
- Intermediate: NIfTI volumes (application/x-nifti)
- Output: Binary segmentation masks (application/x-nifti)

PIPELINE STEPS:
1. DICOM Export → NIfTI Conversion (dcm2niix)
2. Preprocessing → Intensity Normalization
3. Inference → U-Net Segmentation
4. Post-processing → Mask Refinement
5. Evaluation → Dice Score Calculation

EXPECTED OUTPUTS:
- Segmentation masks for each patient
- Performance metrics (Dice, Hausdorff)
- Visualization overlays
