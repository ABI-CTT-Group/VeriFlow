    "description": "This resource presents the MAMA-MIA dataset, a multicenter collection of 1506 pre-treatment T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) cases of breast cancer, featuring expert annotations of primary tumors and non-mass-enhanced regions. The data was sourced from four collections in The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). The dataset includes 49 harmonized clinical and demographic variables, expert-corrected segmentations (derived from preliminary deep learning segmentations verified by 16 experts), and pre-trained weights for a baseline nnU-Net model. It is designed to serve as a benchmark for developing and validating advanced deep learning models for breast cancer diagnostics and treatment response prediction.",
