    "title": "A large-scale multicenter breast cancer DCE-MRI benchmark dataset with expert segmentations",
    "description": "This study presents a multicenter dataset of 1506 pre-treatment T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI cases for breast cancer research. The dataset includes expert annotations of primary tumors and non-mass-enhanced regions. To create this resource, imaging data from four collections in The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) were integrated. A deep learning model was trained to generate preliminary segmentations, which were subsequently corrected and verified by 16 breast cancer experts. The dataset also includes 49 harmonized clinical and demographic variables, as well as pre-trained weights for a baseline nnU-Net model. This resource addresses a critical gap in publicly available breast cancer datasets, enabling the development, validation, and benchmarking of advanced deep learning models for breast cancer diagnostics, treatment response prediction, and personalized care.",
