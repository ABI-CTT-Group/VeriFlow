    "description": "This paper presents a new open-source, end-to-end pipeline for generating structured 3D+t biventricular meshes of the heart across the entire cardiac cycle from Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) data. The pipeline comprises view classification, segmentation of the left and right ventricular chambers and myocardium, contour generation, and model fitting in a fully automated sequence. The use of 3D U-Nets (2D+t segmentation) was explored and found to increase the temporal coherence of resulting meshes compared to 2D U-Nets when evaluated on 10 test cases.",
