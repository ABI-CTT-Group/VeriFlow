    "description": "This resource presents the MAMA-MIA multicenter dataset of 1506 pre-treatment T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI cases, including expert annotations of primary tumors and non-mass-enhanced regions. The dataset integrates imaging data from four collections in The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Preliminary segmentations were generated using a deep learning model and subsequently corrected and verified by 16 breast cancer experts. The dataset includes 49 harmonized clinical and demographic variables, as well as pre-trained weights for a baseline nnU-Net model, addressing a critical gap in publicly available breast cancer datasets for benchmarking advanced deep learning models.",
