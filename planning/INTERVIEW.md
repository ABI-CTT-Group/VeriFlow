## Batch 1: Data Structures & API Contracts

### Q1. SDS Manifest Schema
- [x] What is the **exact JSON schema** for an SDS manifest file?
- [x] Which fields are **required vs optional**?
- [x] What is the **exact format** for provenance links (`wasDerivedFrom`, Tool linking)?

**Answer:**
> Physical format: Excel spreadsheet (`manifest.xlsx`). Backend Agent (via `sds-converter` skill) enforces schema and handles MIME-typing.
> 
> **JSON Schema (Row Level):**
> ```json
> {
>   "filename": "string (required) - Relative path from dataset root",
>   "timestamp": "date-time (required) - Auto-generated by file system",
>   "description": "string (required) - Defaults to 'Data file' if not provided",
>   "file type": "string (optional) - Broad category (text, image)",
>   "additional type": "string (computed) - IANA MIME type, auto-detected by Agent using mimetypes library"
> }
> ```

### Q2. CWL Version & Tool Type
- [x] What **CWL version** are you targeting (v1.0, v1.1, v1.2)?
- [x] Should Tools be described as `CommandLineTool` or `ExpressionTool`?
- [x] How are **input/output types** mapped from SPARC ontology to CWL types?

**Answer:**
> **CWL v1.3**. CWL defines "Processes" with four types:
> - CommandLineTool
> - ExpressionTool  
> - Workflow
> - Operation
> 
> See: https://www.commonwl.org/user_guide/

### Q3. ISA Extraction Output
- [x] What is the **exact data structure** returned by the Scholar Agent after parsing a PDF?
- [x] How is the `Investigation → Study → Assay` hierarchy serialized (JSON schema)?
- [x] How are **confidence scores** represented (0-1 float? percentage? categorical)?

**Answer:**
> Use **ISA-JSON** for serialization. Confidence scores represented as **percentage** (0-100).

---

### Q4. Workflow Graph State
- [x] What is the **graph data structure** for the workflow canvas (React Flow, custom adjacency list)?
- [x] How are **node positions** stored and persisted?
- [x] What is the **connection validation logic** between nodes (type constraints)?

**Answer:**
> Internally, workflows are described in **CWL** which defines relationships between tools and inputs (models, measurements). When run, automatically converted to Airflow DAGs. Workflows serialized when exported in an SDS dataset.

---

## Batch 2: Agent Boundaries & Error Handling

### Q5. Agent Invocation Protocol
- [x] How are the three agents (Scholar, Engineer, Reviewer) **invoked**?
- [x] Are agents **stateless** or do they maintain **session state**?
- [x] What is the **handoff mechanism** between agents?

**Answer:**
> **Direct Gemini API calls**. Agents should **always maintain session state**.

---

### Q6. Error Recovery Strategies
- [x] If **Scholar Agent fails** to extract ISA from a PDF, what happens?
- [x] If **Docker build fails** (Engineer Agent), what is the fallback?
- [x] If **Airflow DAG execution fails** mid-workflow, can users resume?

**Answer:**
> If Scholar fails, the **Reviewer Agent communicates with user** to indicate issues, suggest mitigation strategies, and/or ask additional questions.

---

### Q7. Reviewer Validation Rules
- [x] What are the **specific validation checks** the Reviewer performs?
- [x] How does it detect MIME-type mismatches?
- [x] What information does each agent's session contain?

**Answer:**
> Validation checks include (but not limited to):
> - Syntax check for CWL contents
> - Syntax check for Airflow DAG
> - Data format check for input data
> - Dependency check
> 
> **All validations must pass**. Otherwise, system automatically generates a fix/adapter, or asks user for additional information until validations pass or user decides not to proceed.

## Batch 3: Execution & Runtime Behavior

### Q8. Airflow Integration
- [x] Is Airflow running as a **local container** or a **remote cluster**?
- [x] How does VeriFlow **authenticate** with the Airflow API?
- [x] What is the **polling interval** for job status updates?
- [x] How are **Airflow DAG IDs** generated?

**Answer:**

**Answer:**
> **Default subject limit: 1** for MVP.

---

### Q10. CWL-to-Airflow Conversion
- [x] What is the **exact mapping** between CWL constructs and Airflow operators?

## Batch 5: Edge Cases & MVP Scope

### Q14. Ambiguous Paper Handling
- [x] What happens if a PDF contains **multiple Studies**?
- [x] What if the paper references a **private/paywalled repository**?
- [x] What if the paper's methodology is **too vague**?

**Answer:**
> Include all detected study designs and **let user select which assay** to use.
> 
> For hackathon: Build in **MAMA-MIA paper** as a pre-loaded example. Allow user to either upload a paper OR select from example. This provides constraints to ensure working hackathon demo.

---

### Q15. MVP Scope Boundaries
- [x] Is MAMA-MIA the **only** workflow that must work for MVP?
- [x] Are adapters **pre-built** or **generated on-the-fly**?
- [x] Is "Subject Limiting" required for MVP?

> - Subject limit: Default to 1 for MVP

---

### Q16. Data Persistence & Export
- [x] Can users **save/resume** partially-configured workflows?
- [x] What is the **exact format** of exported SDS datasets?
- [x] Is there a "project" or "workspace" concept?

**Answer:**
> - At any time, one or all data objects can be exported with latest information
> - Only export data objects that have been populated up to point of export (e.g., if workflow not executed, don't export resulting measurements)
> - **No loading state for MVP/hackathon**

## Follow-up Questions (Batch 2) - ANSWERED

### F1. WebSocket Protocol Details
- [x] What is the **WebSocket endpoint URL**?
- [x] What are the **specific JSON message types**?
- [x] How does the client **subscribe** to a specific execution?

**Answer:**
> - Endpoint: `ws://localhost:8000/ws/logs`
> - Use `execution_id` to run workflow
> - Introduce `execution_sub_id` to track execution status of individual workflow tools
> - Message types: Recommend based on best practices

---

### F2. ISA-JSON Confidence Extension
- [x] Should we add a custom extension (e.g., `x-confidence` field)?
- [x] What is the structure: per-Investigation, per-Study, per-Assay, or per-property?

**Answer:**
> **Important Clarification**: Confidence scores are SEPARATE from ISA-JSON.
> 
> - Scholar generates ISA descriptions from paper
> - Confidence score = Scholar's confidence in generated description
> - Confidence is NOT part of ISA-JSON standard (cannot modify standard)
> - Store confidence scores in **separate file within same SDS**
> - ISA descriptions say nothing about where information came from (addressing this is out of scope)

---

### F3. CWL-to-Frontend Graph Mapping
- [x] How should CWL Workflows be transformed to `{nodes, edges}` format?
- [x] What determines **node positioning**?

**Answer:**
> - **Frontend uses Vue 3 with Vue Flow** (NOT React - the UI code provided is React but implementation should recreate in Vue 3)
> - Use **auto-layout algorithm** for node positioning
> - Recommend solution based on best practices for CWL → Vue Flow conversion

---

### F4. MinIO Configuration
- [x] What is the **bucket structure** for SDS datasets?
- [x] Should the backend expose **presigned URLs** for downloads?

**Answer:**
> **Four MinIO buckets:**
> 1. `measurements` - Primary measurement datasets
> 2. `workflow` - Workflow datasets
> 3. `workflow-tool` - Workflow tool datasets
> 4. `process` - Workflow execution output datasets (derived datasets)
> 
> Use **presigned URLs** for downloads.

---

### F5. Pre-loaded Examples
- [x] Should PDF, extracted ISA, CWL workflow, and sample data all be pre-loaded?
- [x] Where should these assets be stored?

**Answer:**
> **Critical Design Decision: Pre-load INPUTS only, NOT results.**
> 
> - Do NOT hard-code final outputs (ISA, CWL, etc.)
> - VeriFlow should process examples by pre-loading inputs to trigger full pipeline
> - **Input-Based Flow**: When user selects example, system fetches PDF URL + Context Text File
> - Context file provides Scholar agent with supplemental details for successful "one-shot" execution
> - **Dynamic Analysis**: Proves AI is actually performing analysis, not displaying static results
> - **Benchmarking**: Use manually verified MAMA-MIA data as Ground Truth to validate pipeline
> - **User Experience**: For hackathon, "PDF + Context" bundle automated behind single click
> 
> **Storage Locations:**
> - Workflow SDS → MinIO `workflow` bucket
> - Workflow Tool SDS → MinIO `workflow-tool` bucket
> - Sample data SDS → MinIO `measurements` bucket

---

### F6. Agent Session State
- [x] What is the **session boundary**?
- [x] How is session state **persisted**?
- [x] What information does each agent's session contain?

**Answer:**
> - Session persistence: **Database**
> - Session content: Recommend based on best practices
